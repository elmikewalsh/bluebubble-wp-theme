BlueBUbble WP Theme - An Updated Remake of the Zenhabits Website

<strong>Languages:</strong> English, Espa√±ol

<p>The BlueBubble WordPress theme is a minimal and elegant theme for WordPress 3.0. It takes advantage of many of the new features included with WordPress 3.0, such as: MultiSite, Custom Headers and the new Menu System. This means you won&rsquo;t have to mess with adding fields to the functions.php file.</p>

<p>In addition, there are several new and exciting features included with this version, including: a new Custom Panel with many new options, 7 different color schemes, a Colorbox pop-up for portfolio options, ability to Tweet any post and an author box with all the author&rsquo;s posts listed.</p>

<p>Oh&hellip;.and did I mention that it is FREE?</p>

<strong>Note:</strong> This is an old WordPress theme. I neither promise nor provide any support.
